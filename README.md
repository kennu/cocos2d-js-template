# Cocos2d-js-template
Kenneth Falck \<kennu@iki.fi\> 2013

## Overview

This is a template project for creating cross-platform games with
Cocos2d-js. The main game is under Resources and can be opened
with CocosBuilder. The common cross-platform C++ code is under Classes.
All platform-specific code is under iOS and Android.

There is a symlink at the top level directory pointing to a local
copy of cocos2d-x-2.1.4. All dependencies will work if that symlink
is fixed to point to the right place. A copy can be downloaded at
http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/Release_Notes_for_Cocos2d-x_v214.
